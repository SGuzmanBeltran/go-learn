## Exercise
Bank Account Simulator
Concepts: Interfaces, mocking, dependency injection

Task: Implement a simple bank account system with Deposit, Withdraw, and GetBalance methods. Use an interface for a database connection, and write tests using a mock database.

## Review
Your implementation for the third exercise is very good! Let's review and rate it:

Rating: 4.5/5 🌟🌟🌟🌟💫

Breakdown:

1. Code Structure and Organization: 5/5 🏗️
   - Excellent separation of implementation and tests
   - Well-defined interface for the database
   - Good use of dependency injection in the Bank struct

2. Test Coverage: 4.5/5 🎯
   - Good coverage for Deposit, Withdraw, and GetBalance methods
   - Tests include various scenarios including edge cases
   - Minor suggestion: Add more test cases for Withdraw when balance is insufficient

3. Mocking: 5/5 🎭
   - Great implementation of MockDatabase
   - Properly simulates database operations for testing

4. Error Handling: 4.5/5 ⚠️
   - Good error checking for invalid inputs
   - Appropriate error messages
   - Minor suggestion: Consider using custom error types for more specific error handling

5. Test Cases Design: 4.5/5 📊
   - Good use of table-driven tests
   - Well-thought-out test cases covering different scenarios
   - Minor suggestion: Add more edge cases (e.g., very large withdrawals)

6. Go Testing Features: 4/5 🛠️
   - Good use of subtests (t.Run)
   - Minor suggestion: Consider adding benchmarks and examples

7. Code Readability: 4.5/5 📖
   - Clear and descriptive function and variable names
   - Well-structured test cases
   - Minor suggestion: Add more comments explaining the purpose of each test function

Overall, this is a strong implementation that demonstrates a good understanding of Go, interfaces, mocking, and testing principles. The code is well-structured and the tests are comprehensive.

To push it to a perfect 5:

1. Add more test cases, especially for edge cases:
   - Withdrawing more than the available balance
   - Very large deposits/withdrawals (to check for potential overflow issues)
   - Concurrent operations (if applicable)

2. Implement custom error types for more specific error handling:

```go
type InsufficientFundsError struct {
    AccountID string
    Requested float64
    Available float64
}

func (e *InsufficientFundsError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("insufficient funds in account %s: requested %.2f, available %.2f", e.AccountID, e.Requested, e.Available)
}
```

3. Add benchmarks to measure performance:

```go
func BenchmarkDeposit(b *testing.B) {
    mockDB := &MockDatabase{}
    bank := NewBank(mockDB)
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        bank.Deposit("test", 100)
    }
}
```

4. Consider adding examples in your test file:

```go
func ExampleBank_Deposit() {
    mockDB := &MockDatabase{}
    bank := NewBank(mockDB)
    bank.Deposit("123", 100)
    balance, _ := bank.GetBalance("123")
    fmt.Printf("Balance after deposit: %.2f\n", balance)
    // Output: Balance after deposit: 100.00
}
```

Great job on this exercise! Your implementation shows a solid grasp of Go testing concepts and best practices. 🎉👏

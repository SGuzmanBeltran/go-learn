## Exercise
Simple Function Testing
Concept: Basic test structure, assertions

Task: Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number, then write unit tests for it. Include tests for normal cases, edge cases (0, 1), and error cases (negative numbers).

## Review
I'm impressed with your implementation! Let's review your exercise response for Exercise 1:
Rating: 4.5/5 🌟🌟🌟🌟💫
Breakdown:

Code Structure and Organization: 5/5 🏗️

Excellent separation of implementation and tests
Well-organized test file with clear, separate test functions


Test Coverage: 5/5 🎯

Covers normal cases, edge cases (0, 1), and error cases (negative numbers)
Includes fuzz testing, which is an advanced concept - great job!


Test Cases Design: 4.5/5 📊

Good use of table-driven tests
Comprehensive set of test cases
Minor suggestion: Consider adding a few more normal cases (e.g., 5, 7)


Error Handling: 4.5/5 ⚠️

Proper error checking in tests
Good negative number handling
Minor suggestion: Consider checking the specific error message for negative numbers


Go Testing Features: 5/5 🛠️

Excellent use of subtests (t.Run)
Inclusion of fuzz testing shows advanced understanding


Code Readability: 4.5/5 📖

Clear variable and function names
Well-structured test cases
Minor suggestion: Consider adding a brief comment explaining the purpose of each test function



Overall, this is an excellent implementation that goes beyond the basic requirements. The inclusion of fuzz testing and the comprehensive test cases demonstrate a solid understanding of Go testing principles. Great job! 🎉
To push it to a perfect 5, consider the minor suggestions above and perhaps add a benchmark test to compare the performance of your factorial function with a recursive implementation.

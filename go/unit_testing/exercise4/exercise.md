## Exercise
HTTP API Handler
Concepts: HTTP testing, JSON marshaling/unmarshaling

Task: Create an HTTP handler for a simple API (e.g., a todo list). Write tests for your handler, including tests for different HTTP methods, status codes, and JSON responses.

## Review
Let me review this todo list API implementation with a teacher's perspective! 📚

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5 stars)

Hey there, student! 👋 I'm really impressed with your work on this HTTP handler implementation. Let's break down what you've done well and where we can make some improvements!

Strong Points 💪:
1. Clean separation of concerns with the Service interface
2. Proper error handling and consistent response formats
3. Great test coverage with different test cases
4. Usage of table-driven tests for POST and DELETE endpoints
5. Input validation (empty description, zero ID checks)

Areas for Improvement 📝:
1. The MockService implementation is a bit too simple - it would be better to add some test data and verify the actual responses
2. DeleteTodoTests struct is empty and unused
3. Could add more edge cases in the tests (e.g., malformed JSON)
4. Consider adding method to update todos (PUT/PATCH endpoint)

Here's a quick suggestion to improve the MockService:

```go
type MockService struct {
    todos []*Todo
}

func NewMockService() *MockService {
    return &MockService{
        todos: []*Todo{
            {Id: 1, Description: "Test Todo", Completed: false},
        },
    }
}

func (m *MockService) GetAllTodos() ([]*Todo, error) {
    return m.todos, nil
}

func (m *MockService) CreateTodo(create CreateTodo) (*Todo, error) {
    todo := &Todo{
        Id:          len(m.todos) + 1,
        Description: create.Description,
        Completed:   create.Completed,
    }
    m.todos = append(m.todos, todo)
    return todo, nil
}
```

Overall, this is a very solid implementation! 🌟 You've demonstrated good understanding of:
- HTTP handlers and routing
- JSON handling in Go
- Test organization
- Error handling patterns
- Interface-based design

Would you like to try adding the update functionality or enhancing the mock service? I'd be happy to guide you through it! 🤓

Keep up the excellent work! 👏

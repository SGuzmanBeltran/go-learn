# Exercise 1: Basic Producer and Consumer

**Objective:** Familiarize yourself with creating a producer and consumer in Go.

1. **Create a topic** called `fun-messages`.

## Producer Task:
- Send 5 messages with fun or quirky jokes.

## Consumer Task:
- Create a consumer that reads and prints each message.

**Goal:** Ensure you can send and receive messages successfully.

**Challenge:** Include a timestamp in each message and print it when consuming.

# Code Review Feedback

## What You Did Well

1. **Clear Structure**: The separation of the producer and consumer code into their respective packages is a good practice. It enhances code organization and readability.

2. **Effective Logging**: You added logging statements that provide clear feedback on the producer and consumer actions. This is helpful for debugging and understanding the flow of your application.

3. **Message Handling**: The use of a loop in the consumer to read messages continuously is spot-on. Additionally, committing the message offset ensures that messages are not reprocessed.

4. **Message Production**: You’ve implemented a simple mechanism to produce messages with a delay, which mimics real-world scenarios where messages might be sent at intervals.

5. **Humorous Content**: The jokes you used make the example engaging and fun, which is a nice touch for exercises!

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Graceful Shutdown**: Consider implementing a way to gracefully shut down both the producer and consumer. This could involve listening for termination signals (like `SIGINT`) and exiting the loop cleanly.

2. **Error Handling**: While you’re already handling errors when producing messages, you might want to add some logic to retry or log more detail about the failure. This would be particularly useful in production scenarios.

3. **Configuration Management**: You can consider moving hardcoded values (like broker address and topic name) to a configuration file or environment variables. This makes your application more flexible and easier to manage.

4. **Concurrency**: Depending on your use case, you might want to explore running the producer and consumer in separate goroutines, especially if they are supposed to operate simultaneously without blocking each other.

5. **Testing**: Consider writing unit tests or integration tests for both your producer and consumer. This will help ensure that changes to the code in the future do not introduce bugs.

## Overall Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (4.5/5)

You did a fantastic job with this exercise, and you're clearly on the right track to mastering Kafka with Go. Keep pushing yourself with more complex scenarios and additional features, such as message serialization or error handling improvements. If you have any specific questions or want to tackle the next exercise, let me know!
